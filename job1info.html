    <h1>full stack developer</h1>
    <p>
        The full stack developer role is a specialized version of the software developer/engineer position.
         As a full stack developer, you'll be crafting code that powers every aspect of a web application.
          This includes both the front end, which brings the visual elements to life, and the back end, which handles the business logic.
          You'll need proficiency in front-end languages like JavaScript, back-end languages such as Python, Ruby, or PHP, and database languages like SQL.
           Your role involves analyzing customer or user needs, designing programs, writing code, testing designs, and documenting programs. You may also assist with upgrades or maintenance.
